# TankLandia
This is the most basic of tank games following Ben Tristem through his C++ learnings for unreal so I can become a right proper developer in Unreal. 

## Focus: Controls
The focus being on smooth controls that feel like a tank game, but still harness "fun".

## The Loop
Get in Tank

Aim towards the Enemy

KABOOM

Repeat
